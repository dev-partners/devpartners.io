**Updated 3/20/2020: No changes in service at this time.**

<!--more-->

First, before we dive in to the details of changes here at Development Partners, we would like to extend 
our most sincere hope that you and your family are staying safe during this terrifying 
coronavirus outbreak. While we have all witnessed a fair amount of anxiety-driven 
craziness out there, it is so encouraging to see all of the neighborly actions that members of
the community have been taking.

For our company, _there have been no changes in the service_ we are able to provide 
(though we might be providing it in our pajamas at certain times). Our entire staff is working 
remotely from home to keep with [social distancing best practices](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/17/817251610/its-time-to-get-serious-about-social-distancing-here-s-how). 
We, being a tech company, are fortunate to be able to work from home when many are not.

The last thing we want to leave you with are a few tips for business owners during these times of constant change:

1. **Keep Your Customers in the Know** - Communicate via your website and social media accounts even if you have no anticipated changes in service, as your customers won’t necessarily interpret a lack of communication as no change!
2. **Offer Online Events Instead** - Consider offering online, live events instead or as an alternate to live event attendance.
3. **Plan for Updates in Advance** - Prepare a plan for how updates will happen if things change. Be sure any vendor you’ll rely on to communicate these changes (i.e., your web development firm or marketing agency) will be available to assist if the time comes. 

Stay safe, stay home (if you can), and wash your hands. Remember, we're all in this together!
